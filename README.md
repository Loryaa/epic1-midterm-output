# Yin-Yang Mandala Art
The Spiral symbolizes spiritual development and our relationship with the universe. <br>
Yin-Yang is the symbol of balance, harmony and that it is the key to prosperity.<br> <br>
I incorporated the usage of for loops and object oriented programming such as classes, objects, methods and functions to come up with my mandala art.<br><br>
